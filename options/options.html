        <h3>What is Cheatsheet?</h3>
        <p>
          CheatSheet is a free to use, open-source browser extension aimed at
          making navigating the internet easier to neurodivergent students.
          Currently, CheatSheetâ€™s tools are aimed at users with Dyslexia,
          Dyscalculia and ADHD.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am developing CheatSheet as part of a final year college project,
          and I intend to keep updating the plugin after I finish my course.

          I do not track, store, or log any user data, including but not limited
          to browsing history, IP addresses, or any other personally
          identifiable information.
        </p>
        <h3>Use of Information:</h3>
        <p>
          Since I do not collect any personal information, I do not use or share
          any information for any purpose. The Extension is designed to operate
          without any data tracking or data collection mechanisms.

          I take data security seriously and have implemented appropriate
          technical and organizational measures to protect the privacy and
          security of my users. However, please note that no method of
          transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure,
          and I cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

        <p>
          My Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
          I do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If
          you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided
          personal information to me, please contact me immediately, and I will
          take steps to delete such information from my records.
        </p>
        <h3>Updates to Privacy Policy:</h3>
        <p>
          I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify
          users of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a
          notice on my website or within the Extension. It is your
          responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
          changes.
